    "desc": "One day, the trees are bare. The next, the city is bursting with pink and white. Suddenly, everyone is outside—phones in hand, snapping away. That's the magic of cherry blossom season in Vancouver. With thousands of cherry trees in full bloom, it's the perfect excuse to slow down and soak it all in. The Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival, which began in 2006, is the city's way of celebrating this fleeting beauty with art, music and community events. Whether it's the Big Picnic at Queen Elizabeth Park, guided blossom walks or live performances under the trees, there's something for everyone.",

March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. This day was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favourite moments and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?",

    "desc": "Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 6 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes.",

It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy.",

A national holiday in Ireland, the festivity is marked by a range of cultural events, parades and traditional music and dance enjoyed across the globe. Interestingly, the first St. Patrick's Day parade wasn't held in Ireland but in the United States. The earliest celebration was organised by Irish vicar Ricardo Artur in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1601. Canada's first St. Patrick's Day parade was held in Montreal in 1824. Here, the festival dates to the 17th century, when Irish immigrants brought their traditions to cities like Montreal and Toronto. Today, major cities such as Toronto, Vancouver and St. John's hold large events featuring bagpipes, dancing and Guinness-fuelled festivities. Pubs fill up early, and landmarks glow green to mark the occasion.",

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.",

Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.",

Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximising daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularised by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving us eight months of extended evening light.",

From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education.

Native to China, the tree has also been introduced to Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Found in China's iconic spots like Nanjing's Plum Blossom Mountain, Wuhan's East Lake and Hangzhou's West Lake, these fleeting blooms attract visitors eager to witness their ephemeral magic. In Chinese culture, these blossoms represent purity and the arrival of spring, whereas in Japan, they symbolise new beginnings. With over 300 varieties, this tree can thrive in gardens of all sizes, offering a variety of shapes and colours. Beyond their visual appeal, plum blossoms are also used to flavour traditional cuisine, such as floral teas and tangy preserved plums. So, why not take the chance to branch out and experience them for yourself?",
