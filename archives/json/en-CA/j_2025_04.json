These tiny songbirds, like many others, bring a pop of colour to the Canadian landscape every spring, sticking around through summer.  Hopping from branch to branch, they spend their day feasting on insects like caterpillars and beetles.",

It is famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.",

Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava—the figure who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan—meditated and taught his students. Legend has it that an emperor's former wife transformed into a tigress out of devotion and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and is believed to have emerged in eight incarnations, giving the monastery its name—the 'Tiger's Nest.'",

They migrate thousands of kilometres from Mexico to the Pacific Northwest, making one of the longest migratory journeys relative to body size. The males arrive first, flashing their signature coppery-orange feathers to claim territory. They perform dramatic aerial dives to impress potential mates, reaching speeds of nearly 80 kilometres per hour. With wings beating up to 42 to 62 times per second based on gender, they burn energy fast, making frequent pit stops at flowers and feeders to fuel up. Once the display is over, the female gets to work, building a soft, camouflaged nest in trees or shrubs, where she raises the tiny chicks on her own.",

These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.",
