Stretching over 2,590 square kilometres, this landscape features towering fjords, winding river valleys and alpine landscapes. More than half of its terrain is blanketed in ice, with glaciers dominating 51% of its area. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.",

It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny! Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today in various countries. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' would visit children and leave behind decorated eggs as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!",

It became a national park in 1919, but its history stretches much further back. The Ancestral Puebloans and later the Southern Paiute people lived here, relying on the Virgin River. Evidence of their presence remains in petroglyphs and archaeological sites. Today, the river continues to carve through the landscape, creating canyons that attract hikers and climbers.",

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse. Today, this monument remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.",

Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.",

It is famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.",

There, he meditated in a cave and is believed to have emerged in eight incarnations, giving the monastery its name—the 'Tiger's Nest.'",

They migrate thousands of kilometres from Mexico to the Pacific Northwest, making one of the longest migratory journeys relative to body size. The males arrive first, flashing their signature coppery-orange feathers to claim territory. They perform dramatic aerial dives to impress potential mates, reaching speeds of nearly 80 kilometres per hour. With wings beating up to 42 to 62 times per second based on gender, they burn energy fast, making frequent pit stops at flowers and feeders to fuel up. Once the display is over, the female gets to work, building a soft, camouflaged nest in trees or shrubs, where she raises the tiny chicks on her own.",

These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",

    "desc": "April is National Frog Month, and let's be honest, frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.",
