    "desc": "On May 8 each year, donkeys get their moment in the sun—though they'd probably prefer the shade. World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.",

Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.",

Established in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia covers over 1,800 square kilometres. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,400 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.",

This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo.

Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe.

    "desc": "In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 40 centimetres tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands.",

    "desc": "Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii, in the United States, takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.",
