    "desc": "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.",

The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.",

What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.",

Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt.",

This annual event, organised by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, raises awareness about the declining giraffe population, which has decreased by nearly 30% over the past 35 years. Masai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa. Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. With only approximately 117,000 giraffes remaining in the wild, the time to act is now.",

    "desc": "Experience the magic of the summer solstice at Seljalandsfoss waterfall in Iceland. Today, the Northern Hemisphere celebrates the longest day of the year, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event. The 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic. Visitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave, offering a unique perspective and making it a favourite spot for photographers. Floodlights illuminate the waterfall at night, creating a magical scene.",

It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching.",

It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen colour vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important.",

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast in the United States. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.",

Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States. She sought to pay tribute to her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads.",

    "desc": "The Five Towers, known as 'Fünf Türme' in German and 'Cinc Toires' in Ladin, rise majestically in the heart of the Dolomites in the province of Belluno in the Veneto region of Italy. They offer the perfect refuge from the summer heat and crowded beaches. Each tower has its own story to tell: of ancient civilisations, adventurous hikers, daring climbers and distant battles. Shaped by time and weather, these Dolomite spires played a strategic role during the First World War, and it is still possible today to explore the trenches and remnants of that conflict-scarred past. However, nature is stronger than history: green pastures embrace the towers, the wind carries the scent of pines and a clear sky opens above paths that beckon you to explore. Streams meander through flower-filled meadows while birdsong accompanies every step.",

The 3,242 square kilometres area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for 1,940 metres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's the longest continuous barrier reef in the world.",
