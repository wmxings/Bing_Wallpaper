    "desc": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for 1,940 metres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

Winding 4,265 kilometres from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hike dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West.

Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for. If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. Today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other transport options.",

    "desc": "It is easy to call a place remote. It's harder to understand what that really means—until you stand on Fogo Island in Newfoundland and Labrador. With just over 2,000 residents spread across 11 tight-knit outports, life here moves to its own rhythm. From Tilting to Joe Batt's Arm, these settlements were founded by Irish and English fishers centuries ago. The traditions they introduced can still be witnessed in the island festivals like mummering in winter, boat launches in summer and kitchen parties year-round. Fishing was the backbone for generations, and even now, the sea's pulse is never far off.",

At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's the longest continuous barrier reef in the world.",
