    "desc": "Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet. Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for. If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. Today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other transport options.",

    "desc": "It is easy to call a place remote. It's harder to understand what that really means—until you stand on Fogo Island in Newfoundland and Labrador. With just over 2,000 residents spread across 11 tight-knit outports, life here moves to its own rhythm. From Tilting to Joe Batt's Arm, these settlements were founded by Irish and English fishers centuries ago. The traditions they introduced can still be witnessed in the island festivals like mummering in winter, boat launches in summer and kitchen parties year-round. Fishing was the backbone for generations, and even now, the sea's pulse is never far off.",

On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's the longest continuous barrier reef in the world.",
