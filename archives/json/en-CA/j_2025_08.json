    "desc": "They may resemble ancient statues, but the monoliths of the Mingan Archipelago weren't carved by human hands. These limestone formations began taking shape over 450 million years ago by the power of sea spray, waves and wind. The result? Towering stone pillars that now rise along Quebec's coastline, standing firm as the tide continues its slow work. The surrounding tide pools come alive at low tide, revealing starfish, sea urchins and other marine life. The Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, where these formations are found, is a quiet haven for wildlife established in 1984. The area is a seasonal stop for Atlantic puffins, which arrive between late May and August to breed and raise their chicks on the cliffs and grassy spaces. The park is also known for its seabird colonies, seal sightings and plant life adapted to harsh coastal conditions. It's a landscape that quietly speaks of time, tide and resilience.",

    "copyright": "© Andy Rouse/Nature Picture Library",
    "desc": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.",

These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.",
