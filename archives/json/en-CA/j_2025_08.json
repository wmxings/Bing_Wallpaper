    "desc": "There's no easing into the wild here—the Avalanche Lake Trail carves a bold path through rock scrambles, narrow ledges and alpine serenity. Tucked away in the Adirondack High Peaks in New York, United States, this 0.04-square-kilometres alpine lake sits at nearly 880 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 370 metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name.",

Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at over CAD 400 billion. Canada is home to over 800 native bee species, with honey bees playing a major role in pollinating crops like blueberries, apples and canola. Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan lead in honey production. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.",

After a 2.4-kilometre walk, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high.

    "desc": "Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild. Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.",

These limestone formations began taking shape over 450 million years ago by the power of sea spray, waves and wind. The result? Towering stone pillars that now rise along Quebec's coastline, standing firm as the tide continues its slow work. The surrounding tide pools come alive at low tide, revealing starfish, sea urchins and other marine life. The Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, where these formations are found, is a quiet haven for wildlife established in 1984. The area is a seasonal stop for Atlantic puffins, which arrive between late May and August to breed and raise their chicks on the cliffs and grassy spaces. The park is also known for its seabird colonies, seal sightings and plant life adapted to harsh coastal conditions. It's a landscape that quietly speaks of time, tide and resilience.",

The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.",

Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.",
