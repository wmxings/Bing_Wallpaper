    "desc": "Quick, clever and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.",

Also residing here is one of the most iconic symbols of the North American wilderness—the grizzly bear. Don't be fooled by their shaggy coats and lumbering walk—these predators can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still run at 56 km/h. Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen survival skills and figure out their place in bear society. It may look cute, but it's serious practice for life in the wild.",

This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.",
