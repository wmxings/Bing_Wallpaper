    "desc": "Some towns evolve slowly over centuries. Pienza? It received a full rebrand in the 1400s from a pope who wanted to prove a point—and maybe show off a little. This tiny Italian town is perched above the Val d'Orcia, surrounded by rolling hills that look exactly like you think Tuscany should: cypress trees, winding dirt roads, the occasional sheep. It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.",

This tree isn't just a pretty face—its sap is a key ingredient in Canada's famous maple syrup. Most syrup, however, comes from sugar maples, though black maples and red maples also contribute. Curious how? In spring, taps collect sap when nights are still freezing and days begin to warm. Boil it down, and what's left is the sweet syrup you drizzle on pancakes. Canada produces more than 70% of global maple syrup, with Quebec leading production.",

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 17-20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.",

It marks the beginning of fall in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change. Sites like Chichén Itzá in Mexico and England's Stonehenge were designed to align with the rising or setting sun during equinox days.",

First held in 1810 as a royal wedding celebration, it now draws some 6 million revellers over the span of over two weeks. The scale is astonishing: around 420,000 square metres packed with 14 grand beer tents, vast quantities of pretzels, sausages and ginger-bread hearts. Beyond the brews and brats, the fairground is a carnival in its own, teeming with roller coasters, games and thrill rides like the Wellenflug swing carousel, offering sweeping views of the festivities and Munich skyline. This year, the Munich celebration starts today and runs through 5 October.",

Seen from 362 kilometres above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.",

While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.",

    "desc": "Established in 1918 to preserve the aftermath of the Novarupta eruption, Katmai National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, United States, spans over 16,500 square kilometres of raw wilderness. It is home to the alpine tundra, boreal forests and salmon-rich rivers that support brown bears, moose, wolves and hundreds of bird species, including the rare Aleutian tern. Also residing here is one of the most iconic symbols of the North American wilderness—the grizzly bear. Don't be fooled by their shaggy coats and lumbering walk—these predators can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still run at 56 km/h. Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen survival skills and figure out their place in bear society. It may look cute, but it's serious practice for life in the wild.",

This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.",
