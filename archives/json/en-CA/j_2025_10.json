When city lights fade, the night sky unfolds: constellations, distant galaxies and occasionally the dance of the northern lights above Patricia Lake, which draws gasps from even seasoned stargazers. Jasper Dark Sky Festival kicks off today and runs through 26 October, marking its 15th anniversary. Imagine being guided by astronomers using telescopes, watching a space-themed movie under the stars wrapped in a cosy blanket, hearing stories about nebulae and meteor showers, night hiking on Pyramid Beach or learning how to photograph the Milky Way.",

Stretching up to more than 100 centimetres in length and standing around 75 centimetres at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares and squirrels.",

This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.",

For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.",

Twice a year, billions of migratory birds crisscross the globe, flying thousands of kilometres between breeding and wintering grounds. That epic commute is exactly what World Migratory Bird Day highlights. From the Arctic tern, which logs about 71,000 kilometres a year, to the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight, these seasonal fliers show what endurance really looks like. Observed on the second Saturday in May and October, the day also draws attention to the challenges migratory birds face: habitat loss, climate change and light pollution can all disrupt their routes.",

The day begins with formal ceremonies, where the Fijian flag is hoisted and leaders deliver speeches. Schools and community groups often stage reenactments and performances. Streets fill with parades, villages host cultural dances like the meke and rugby pitches come alive with matches. Families prepare traditional dishes like lovo, where meat and root crops are cooked underground, and kokoda, a citrus-marinated fish dish.",

The change usually begins in September and early October, with higher slopes turning first, followed by the lower valleys. Among the stars of this display are the aspens, whose leaves shimmer like gold coins in the sunlight. The magic of aspen colours, however, isn't guaranteed year after year. Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colours and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance. A spot that dazzled one fall might look muted the next.",

Nuit Blanche Toronto returns for its 19th edition, taking place overnight from October 4 into the morning of October 5. This year, the cultural event invites artists to 'translate the city' by exploring the intersections of language, history and identity within an ever-evolving urban landscape. Artist Ellen Pau's 'The Eye of Wisdom' appears as a large-scale projection incorporating Hong Kong Sign Language as a public love letter. Head downtown and explore curator Charlene K. Lau's 'Poetic Justice,' which delves into land, treaties and the city's layered past. Look up and you might spot Cassils' project 'Undersight,' flashing 'deemed suspect' words into the evening sky using Morse code just like a Bat-Signal.",

On the Isle of Skye, Scotland's fabled 'Misty Isle,' the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.",

One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. On calm days, Mount Moran can be seen reflected on the surface of the water. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this Act in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken. At dawn, mist dances over the bend and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.",
