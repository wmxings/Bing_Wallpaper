Nuit Blanche Toronto returns for its 19th edition, taking place overnight from October 4 into the morning of October 5. This year, the cultural event invites artists to 'translate the city' by exploring the intersections of language, history and identity within an ever-evolving urban landscape. Artist Ellen Pau's 'The Eye of Wisdom' appears as a large-scale projection incorporating Hong Kong Sign Language as a public love letter. Head downtown and explore curator Charlene K. Lau's 'Poetic Justice,' which delves into land, treaties and the city's layered past. Look up and you might spot Cassils' project 'Undersight,' flashing 'deemed suspect' words into the evening sky using Morse code just like a Bat-Signal.",

On the Isle of Skye, Scotland's fabled 'Misty Isle,' the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.",

One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. On calm days, Mount Moran can be seen reflected on the surface of the water. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this Act in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken. At dawn, mist dances over the bend and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.",

Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image.
