Its sky served as both compass and calendar, guiding celestial events and shaping temples, rituals and the rhythm of life. Around 426 CE, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', a warrior from the Maya heartland, founded Copán and established its royal dynasty. The city became a centre of Maya art, astronomy and power.",

Its sleek body can reach speeds of over 120 km/h, making it the fastest land mammal on Earth. Long legs and a flexible spine allow incredible acceleration, while its strong tail helps maintain balance during high-speed chases. Today is International Cheetah Day—an event that couldn't have arrived any quicker. With fewer than 7,100 individuals left in the wild, these are among Africa's most vulnerable big cats.",

    "desc": "What's your winter personality: cosy wanderer or slope-chaser? Whistler, in British Columbia, lets you try both in the same day. This resort municipality sits about 125 kilometres north of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains, with two main ski peaks: Whistler and Blackcomb. These are linked by the PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola, famous for giving a suspended, panoramic valley view in just a few minutes of travel. The area gained fame when it co-hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, and some of those venues are still open to the public today. The name 'Whistler' comes from the high-pitched call of the local hoary marmots that were once common around the slopes.",
