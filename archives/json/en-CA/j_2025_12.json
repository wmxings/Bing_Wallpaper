The bridge spans almost 140 metres across the Capilano River and sits 70 metres above it, held by strong cables that give a gentle sway as you walk. The idea took shape in 1889, when Scottish civil engineer George Grant Mackay built the first version using hemp rope and cedar planks. Wire cables replaced the original materials in 1903, and the site slowly expanded into a popular outdoor spot cherished by many.",

It is a slow, shallow sheet of water that drifts south across flat grasslands toward Florida Bay, linking forests, marshes, mangroves and coastal prairies. This subtropical wilderness supports hundreds of species, including alligators, manatees and the endangered Florida panther. In 1947, the United States established the Everglades National Park, protecting over 6,100 square kilometres and shifting conservation toward preserving entire ecosystems rather than isolated landmarks.",

This resort municipality sits about 125 kilometres north of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains, with two main ski peaks: Whistler and Blackcomb. These are linked by the PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola, famous for giving a suspended, panoramic valley view in just a few minutes of travel. The area gained fame when it co-hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, and some of those venues are still open to the public today. The name 'Whistler' comes from the high-pitched call of the local hoary marmots that were once common around the slopes.",
