Enter Hen Galan, the 'Old New Year,' observed on January 13 in parts of Wales, most famously in the Gwaun Valley. The date survives from the old Julian calendar, kept long after the rest of Britain adopted the Gregorian one.",

Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.",

In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.",
