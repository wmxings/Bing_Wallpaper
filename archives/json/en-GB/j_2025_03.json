    "desc": "For one Sunday in March, the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries take a break from the usual hustle to honour mums with flowers, cards and the occasional burnt toast in bed. Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration.",

Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent.",

Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 134-metre summit for breathtaking panoramic views.",

Interestingly, the first St Patrick's Day parade wasn't held in Ireland but in the United States.

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.",

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.",

This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honour today.",

The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image.

Rising 310 metres above England's capital, this glass-clad giant is not just the tallest building in the United Kingdom but also a symbol of modern London. It was designed by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect known for making a statement with high-tech, lightweight and functional designs. Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009, and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper.",

First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate.",

    "desc": "A leek, a daffodil and a day to remember: Happy Saint David's Day! Today, Wales celebrates its patron saint and all things Welsh. Saint David was a 6th-century monk, bishop and preacher who played a key role in spreading Christianity across the country. He founded several religious communities known for their simple, disciplined lifestyles. One of his most famous sayings, 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain,' still resonates today as a reminder that small acts of kindness and faith matter. But why do people wear leeks and daffodils? Legend has it that the saint advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets to distinguish themselves from the enemy in battle against the Saxons. The daffodil, meanwhile, became popular later as a more visually appealing national emblem, especially during the 19th century.",
