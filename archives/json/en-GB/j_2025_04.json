    "desc": "Welcome to Saguaro National Park in Arizona, United States. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak, which is the tallest point in the Tucson Mountains at more than 1,400 metres. Hikers can reach the summit via trails like King Canyon, Hugh Norris or Sweetwater, all winding through towering saguaros, prickly pear cacti and desert wildflowers. At the top of the park, the Tucson Basin, Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains stretch into the horizon, making the climb worth every step. Named after John Wasson, a 19th-century American journalist, the peak also holds traces of the Hohokam people and Arizona's mining past, including the Gould Mine. Whether you're here for the views, history, or challenge, Wasson Peak is a true desert adventure—just don't underestimate the Arizona sun!",

    "desc": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",
