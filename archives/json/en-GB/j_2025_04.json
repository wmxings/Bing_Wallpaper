    "desc": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.",

This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.",

    "desc": "Today, we celebrate International Beaver Day! Established in 2009 by Beavers Wetlands & Wildlife, this day highlights the vital role beavers play in our ecosystems. Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to a metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers.",

It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.",

These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there.
