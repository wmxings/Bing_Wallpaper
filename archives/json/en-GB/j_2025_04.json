    "desc": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a penny—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms.",
