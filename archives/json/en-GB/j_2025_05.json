The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats.",

For over three decades, the Hay Festival has turned this border town into a buzzing hub of stories, ideas and page-turning excitement. What started in 1988 around a kitchen table and a shared love of books, has grown into one of the world's best-known literary gatherings. Held over 10 days in late May to early June, the festival draws writers, thinkers, poets, politicians, comedians, musicians and curious readers from every corner. Big names like Margaret Atwood, Stephen Fry and Martin Rees have all graced the stage.",

The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.",

Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.",

The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans 6.9 metres, with the minute hands measuring 4.3 metres. At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament.",

Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process.",

Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,500 metres tall.

Home to the Minnesota Senate, the House of Representatives, the governor's office and the attorney general's office, this building also houses a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court. Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world.",

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.",

The beach stays put, but the city transforms into a giant stage during the Brighton Festival—a three-week celebration where art spills out of theatres, dances down alleyways and occasionally juggles fire on the seafront. Started in 1967, the Brighton Festival has grown into one of England's largest curated multi-arts festivals. This year, the fest is taking place from 3 to 26 May in venues across Brighton, Hove and Sussex, featuring 120 events, exhibitions and installations. Each year, the event hands the creative reins to a guest director, often an artist with something fresh to say. From authors to musicians to activists, these directors shape the theme and vibe of the festival. Grammy-nominated, genre-defying musician, composer, and activist Anoushka Shankar was inspired by the theme of 'New Dawn' for this year's programme.",

This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe.

On May 1, Hawaii, United States, celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.",
