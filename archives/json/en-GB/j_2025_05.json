But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their colour-shifting skills, zippy tongues and wild adaptations. With over 200 species found in diverse habitats, these reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.",

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.",

The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.",

The beach stays put, but the city transforms into a giant stage during the Brighton Festival—a three-week celebration where art spills out of theatres, dances down alleyways and occasionally juggles fire on the seafront. Started in 1967, the Brighton Festival has grown into one of England's largest curated multi-arts festivals. This year, the fest is taking place from 3 to 26 May in venues across Brighton, Hove and Sussex, featuring 120 events, exhibitions and installations. Each year, the event hands the creative reins to a guest director, often an artist with something fresh to say. From authors to musicians to activists, these directors shape the theme and vibe of the festival. Grammy-nominated, genre-defying musician, composer, and activist Anoushka Shankar was inspired by the theme of 'New Dawn' for this year's programme.",

Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe.

It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands.",

    "desc": "Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii, United States, celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.",
