    "desc": "Long before neckties and greeting cards, Father's Day began with a daughter's quiet act of remembrance and steadfast love. In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster in West Virginia, United States, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States. She sought to pay tribute to her father, an American Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads.",

Trooping the Colour is a centuries-old military tradition, held each June to mark the official birthday of the reigning monarch—even if their actual birthday is in, say, November. The real reason? The weather's better. No one wants to troop anything through puddles. There's marching, music, horses, salutes—and a good chance of spotting a royal in a bearskin or bonnet.",

The 801,163-acre (324,219-hectare) area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres (607,000 hectares). It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds.

    "desc": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

This street was built between 1829 and 1834 as part of a plan to modernise the city and improve access to Grassmarket from George IV Bridge. The architect, Thomas Hamilton, took one look at the steep hill and decided to lean into it—literally—designing a graceful curve that follows the natural contour of the land. He even added a terrace of arched shops on the upper level, creating a sort of two-tiered retail sandwich.",

Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for.",

    "desc": "When it comes to fast flyers with a flair for flowers, the skipper butterfly makes quite the landing. These pint-sized pollinators are easy to miss—until you spot one zipping through your garden as if it's late for an appointment. Catch one pausing on an Echinacea flower—like the one photographed at the Rockefeller State Park in New York, United States—and you've hit the jackpot. Skippers aren't your average butterflies. Technically part of the superfamily Papilionoidea, they're often mistaken for moths thanks to their stout bodies and erratic flight patterns. But unlike moths, they're active by day, have clubbed antennae with a hook at the end and wings they usually hold at quirky angles. Their name? It comes from their quick, darting flight.",

On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles and migrating humpback whales.",
