    "desc": "Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida, United States, is Rainbow Springs State Park. This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the crystal-clear Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.",

    "desc": "That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone.",

    "desc": "Today, Canada turns another year older. Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day' in the American sense, it's the closest thing to it. Locals celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts and community events. Ottawa, the capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill. Red-and-white flags, maple leaf face paint and singalongs of the national anthem, 'O Canada,' are all part of the day.",
