Once the site of a bustling market square known as the Plaza del Arrabal, this historic space has witnessed the city's transformation over the centuries. The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid's jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo. Inspired by a vision of order and grandeur, King Philip II reimagined the square—though construction did not actually begin until 1617, under the reign of Philip III.",

Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles and even small mammals.",

But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.",

These medium-sized deer have been strutting through British woodlands and parklands for centuries. Though they look right at home, they weren't born here. The Romans likely brought them over, and the Normans later made them common in hunting parks. Now, they're regulars in landscapes from Sussex to Scotland.",

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbours, waterfront homes and a growing valley community.",

Tucked away in New York's Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre (3.6 hectares) alpine lake sits at over 850 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—an over 300-metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 9.6 miles round trip with a more than 400-metre elevation, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it's the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.",

At the heart of it all is the Isle of Wight Garlic Farm, famous for its black garlic, elephant garlic and just about every variety in between.

It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either.",

Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country. Also known as Little Rainbow Bridge, it shares visual similarities with the iconic Rainbow Bridge arch near Lake Powell—but Corona Arch holds its own in a more peaceful setting.",

Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.",

With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. The Dolomites themselves—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—rise dramatically behind the village, their pale limestone faces glowing pink at sunset in a phenomenon locals call 'enrosadira.'",

Founded in 1273 by Lady Dervorguilla of Galloway, this Cistercian abbey wasn't just built for monks and prayers—it was built for love. When her husband, John de Balliol, passed away, Dervorguilla had his heart embalmed and placed in a silver casket. She carried it with her everywhere, like a medieval love letter on repeat. When she died, the heart was buried with her at the abbey she named in his memory—Dulce Cor, or 'Sweet Heart.'",

The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.",

Held annually in early August, this event, scheduled for 2 to 8 August this year, is one of the oldest and largest sailing regattas in the world. Thousands of amateur and professional sailors compete in around 40 daily races, making it as much about precision and patience as it is about power. From sleek modern boats to seasoned classics, it's a floating festival of variety.",
