Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honours their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face.",

Each summer, the Isle of Wight's northern shores transform into a sea of sails, strategy and salt-sprayed excitement. Since 1826, this regatta has been reeling in sailors and spectators alike—and it's still going strong. Held annually in early August, this event, scheduled for 2 to 8 August this year, is one of the oldest and largest sailing regattas in the world. Thousands of amateur and professional sailors compete in around 40 daily races, making it as much about precision and patience as it is about power. From sleek modern boats to seasoned classics, it's a floating festival of variety.",
