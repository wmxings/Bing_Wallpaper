First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behaviour and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.",

The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.",

While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.",
