    "desc": "Mists curl, waters glimmer and legends linger—welcome to Glen Brittle. On the Isle of Skye, Scotland's fabled 'Misty Isle,' the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.",

    "desc": "If words were musical notes, poetry would be the song that never fades. Each year, National Poetry Day gives language its moment in the spotlight, inviting people to read, write and share verses that stir thought or spark a smile. Launched in 1994 by the Forward Arts Foundation, the day falls on the first Thursday of October. It isn't just for seasoned poets—it's for schoolchildren scribbling rhymes, commuters catching a poem on the Tube and anyone willing to pause and let lines linger. Every year carries a theme, steering the creativity of classrooms, libraries and festivals across the nation. This year's theme is play.",
