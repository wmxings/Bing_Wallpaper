Arched galleries, sweeping colonnades and domes that echo ancient architecture compete for your attention. Every street shifts in style—compact Baroque facades give way to broad Neoclassical courtyards. Continue exploring and you will arrive at a wide square with a building that appears Roman at first sight. That's the Basilica of San Francesco di Paola, located on the west side of Piazza del Plebiscito.",

That quiet reveal says everything about how these cats operate. They move with precision, slipping through grass and branches without making a sound. Their build, muscular but lean, helps them climb, sprint and hide in plain sight. Their rosetted coats? No two patterns match, each serving as natural camouflage from sunrise to moonlight.",

This one makes you work for it—857 steps, eight bastions and centuries of power plays later, the Fortress of Palamidi still believes history should be earned the hard way. Rising 216 metres above the city of Nafplio in Greece, this Venetian-built stronghold dates to 1714. Each bastion of this impressive fortification is designed as an independent unit so that if one fell, the others could still be defended. The Ottomans captured the fortress a year after completion, and Greece reclaimed it in 1822, renaming the bastions after heroes like Achilles and Leonidas. Today, visitors often test themselves on the fortress's famous staircase—once believed to have 999 steps, though the actual count is 857. At the top, sweeping views of the Argolic Gulf make every step worthwhile.",

This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the United States, United Kingdom and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.",

In Arches National Park, Utah, United States, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.",

Rising over 1,700 metres and sitting roughly 22 miles northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.",

This is the landscape a young traveller, JRR Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.",

Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.",
