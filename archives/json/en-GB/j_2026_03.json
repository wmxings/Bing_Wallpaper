    "desc": "Do not be fooled by how simple Ko Samui's longtail boats look from a distance; decades of local ingenuity have shaped their slender frames. These vessels, known in Thailand as 'ruea hang yao,' emerged in the early 20th century, when fishermen repurposed vehicle engines to navigate shallow waters that larger boats couldn't reach. Handcrafted plank by plank, each boat reflects generations of skill. Their hulls burst with bold, striking colours, while decorative cloth and flowers often crown the bows—Buddhist blessings meant to safeguard both the boat and its crew.",

Saint David's Day celebrates Welsh identity with quiet pride and a good sense of humour. Saint David was a 6th-century preacher and monastic founder whose advice to 'do the little things' still does the rounds on banners, mugs and moral compasses.",
