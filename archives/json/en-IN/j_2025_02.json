    "desc": "Welcome to the year 2152. That is, in the Tibetan calendar at least. Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead. Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 3,048 metres above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students.",

    "desc": "Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. It is important that we reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators.",

    "desc": "Today is Maha Shivaratri, a festival marked by fasting, meditation and an all-night vigil in honour of Lord Shiva. Celebrated between February and March, it falls on the fourteenth night of the waning moon in the Hindu month of Phalguna. But what makes this festival truly special? It marks the union of Shiva and Parvati and the powerful Tandava dance performed by Shiva. What would be a better place to experience the divine presence of Shiva than Tungnath, featured here? One of the highest Shiva temples in the world, Tungnath is perched high in the Himalayas at 3,680 metres. This sacred site, in Uttarakhand's Rudraprayag district, is the loftiest of the five Panch Kedar temples, and sits just below the majestic Chandrashila peak.",
