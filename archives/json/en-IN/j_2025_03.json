    "desc": "As Shakespeare wrote in his play 'Julius Caesar,' 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.' Today is the Ides of March, a day steeped in Roman history and tradition. The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.",

Among the many traditions associated with this festival, one stands out—Lathmar Holi, or the 'Holi of sticks,' seen in today's image. This unique celebration takes place in the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon in Uttar Pradesh. It is observed the day after Laddu Holi, where women playfully shower men with laddoos. Rooted in the legend of Radha and Krishna, this festival brings an age-old tale to life. As the story goes, Lord Krishna, hailing from Nandgaon and regarded as the son-in-law of Vrishabhanu, wished to drench his beloved Radha and her friends in colours. However, when he and his companions arrived in Barsana, they were met with playful resistance—Radha and her friends chased them away with sticks. This lively tradition continues to this day during Holi.",

They weigh around 1.5 kilograms and can grow up to 1.5 metres in length. These reptiles are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. Researchers believe that both Galápagos land iguanas and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor that likely rafted from Central or South America. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing.",

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. Today, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture.",

    "desc": "One of India's most sought-after destinations, the Kedarkantha peak is a trekker's paradise, renowned for its snow-covered trails. In the Govind Pashu Vihar National Park of Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, this mountain peak stands at 3,800 metres. What sets this spot apart is its exhilarating summit climb, which attracts countless trekkers to the Indian Himalayas. The forests surrounding Kedarkantha are dominated by towering pine trees, with deodar, oak and rhododendron adding to the region's greenery. The rare blue poppy and other blooms bring colour to the terrain. This area is also home to species like the Himalayan snow cock, kala titar, chakor, magpie, thrush, paradise flycatcher, parakeet and bulbul. Beyond its avian residents, the region shelters a variety of wildlife, including the elusive Himalayan black bear. Marmots and various other rodents also inhabit this zone, while leopards, tigers, barking deer (kakar) and sambhar occasionally make an appearance.",

First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. Today's image features the Fearless Girl, boldly facing the New York Stock Exchange in the United States. Unveiled in 2017, the statue was commissioned to highlight the lack of women in corporate leadership roles. With her fists on her hips, head held high and a confident stance, she symbolises female empowerment.",

Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness.
