Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering over 4,900 square kilometres. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.",

Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.",

This geothermal marvel is fuelled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters.",

Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), we are invited to turn off our lights and gaze at the stars. The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, an American high school student, in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is in the United States, in Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, which is an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder.",

In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' would visit children and leave behind decorated eggs as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings.

A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye.

People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century.

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.",

Established by the International Association of Art in honour of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this global celebration promotes creativity in all its forms. Art has been a cornerstone of human civilisation for thousands of years, from prehistoric cave paintings to digital masterpieces. Beyond the sculptures and paintings found in galleries and museums, art also lives in street murals, sand sculptures and even beach art, as seen here, proving that creativity knows no bounds. World Art Day, officially observed in 21 countries, is a celebration for everyone, whether you're a collector, a creator or simply someone who finds joy in the colors and textures of everyday life.",

Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.",

From leaping through waves to chatting in clicks and whistles, dolphins are all about social life. Take the Atlantic spotted dolphin—featured here—known for the spots on its body, which multiply and become denser with age. They are highly social creatures, often forming dynamic groups of 5–15 individuals, sometimes mingling with common bottlenose dolphins. Known for their speed and agility, they frequently engage in bow-riding and perform long, shallow leaps across the water. These dolphins are also skilled nocturnal hunters, working together to corral their prey—primarily small fish, benthic invertebrates and squid. When confronting other species, they tend to use physical tactics like biting and chasing, whereas within their own groups, they rely more on visual displays to assert dominance.",

Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet.

This magnificent monument in Delhi, is India's first-ever garden tomb and the final resting place of Mughal emperor Humayun. This grand structure was commissioned by Humayun's chief consort, Bega Begum (also called Haji Begum). Determined to honour the emperor's legacy, Bega Begum entrusted Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas with bringing her vision to reality. However, he passed away before the project's completion, leaving his son, Sayyid Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyath Ud Din, to carry forward his work. Construction began in 1565, nine years after Humayun's passing, and was completed in 1572.",

    "desc": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 2 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species.",
