    "desc": "Imagine a world without colour, music or design—how dull would life be? Every April 15, World Art Day reminds us of the beauty, inspiration and culture that art brings into our lives. Established by the International Association of Art in honour of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this global celebration promotes creativity in all its forms. Art has been a cornerstone of human civilisation for thousands of years, from prehistoric cave paintings to digital masterpieces. Beyond the sculptures and paintings found in galleries and museums, art also lives in street murals, sand sculptures and even beach art, as seen here, proving that creativity knows no bounds. World Art Day, officially observed in 21 countries, is a celebration for everyone, whether you're a collector, a creator or simply someone who finds joy in the colors and textures of everyday life.",

Grand processions at Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai and Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur draw large crowds, while tributes and cultural events take place nationwide. National leaders honour Ambedkar at the Parliament. Beyond India, the celebration resonates globally, especially among Dalits, Adivasis, labourers, women and those inspired by his Buddhist ideals.",

    "desc": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.",

No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. So, take a moment to appreciate these incredible ecosystem engineers and their hardworking, tree-chomping ways.

From leaping through waves to chatting in clicks and whistles, dolphins are all about social life. Take the Atlantic spotted dolphin—featured here—known for the spots on its body, which multiply and become denser with age. They are highly social creatures, often forming dynamic groups of 5–15 individuals, sometimes mingling with common bottlenose dolphins. Known for their speed and agility, they frequently engage in bow-riding and perform long, shallow leaps across the water. These dolphins are also skilled nocturnal hunters, working together to corral their prey—primarily small fish, benthic invertebrates and squid. When confronting other species, they tend to use physical tactics like biting and chasing, whereas within their own groups, they rely more on visual displays to assert dominance.",

Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet.

This magnificent monument in Delhi, is India's first-ever garden tomb and the final resting place of Mughal emperor Humayun. This grand structure was commissioned by Humayun's chief consort, Bega Begum (also called Haji Begum). Determined to honour the emperor's legacy, Bega Begum entrusted Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas with bringing her vision to reality. However, he passed away before the project's completion, leaving his son, Sayyid Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyath Ud Din, to carry forward his work. Construction began in 1565, nine years after Humayun's passing, and was completed in 1572.",

    "desc": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.",

    "desc": "Today's image features a tree frog. Frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 2 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species.",
