Mother's Day is a time to honour the women who shape our lives, celebrating motherhood, unbreakable bonds and their lasting impact on society. While the modern American version of this holiday began in the early 20th century, the celebration of motherhood has existed for centuries across cultures. Social activist Anna Jarvis led the inaugural Mother's Day worship service in 1908 at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia, United States, now home to the International Mother's Day Shrine.",

Home to the Minnesota Senate, the House of Representatives, the governor's office and the attorney general's office, this building also houses a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world. This dome is built in three layers, each serving a different purpose. The outermost layer, made of Georgia marble, holds itself up by sheer weight alone. Inside, a brick-and-steel cone adds support and helps drain water to withstand Minnesota's harsh winters. The innermost layer is the beautifully decorated dome visible from the rotunda. Resting at its base, twelve marble eagles stand alongside the surrounding columns. Crowning the structure is an elegant stone lantern, topped with a gleaming gold-leaf-covered finial globe.",

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.",

The celebrations are most vibrant at Santiniketan, particularly at Visva-Bharati University, founded by Tagore. Born in 1861, Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath and was revered as Gurudeb, Kobiguru and Biswokob. He reshaped literature, music and art during the Bengal Renaissance. He also became the first non-European—and the first lyricist—to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his ethereal work 'Gitanjali.'",

Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.",

It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands. The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves more than 3 metres in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world.",
