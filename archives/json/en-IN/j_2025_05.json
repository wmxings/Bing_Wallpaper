Observed annually on the 25th day of Boishakh in the Bengali calendar (usually early May), it commemorates the birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. The celebrations are most vibrant at Santiniketan, particularly at Visva-Bharati University, founded by Tagore. Born in 1861, Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath and was revered as Gurudeb, Kobiguru and Biswokob. He reshaped literature, music and art during the Bengal Renaissance. He also became the first non-European—and the first lyricist—to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his ethereal work 'Gitanjali.'",

Below, the world's oldest desert, the Namib, stretches endlessly, shaped by winds over 55 million years. This is Namibia—a surreal landscape of towering dunes, dry riverbeds and shifting sands. Unlike traditional aircraft, ultralights offer an unmatched sense of freedom. Also known as microlights, these small planes are designed for low-altitude, slow-speed flying. Their weight and speed limits vary by country; in India, they should weigh under 450 kilograms without parachute.",

The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.",

It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands. The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves more than 3 metres in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world.",
