    "desc": "The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself.",
