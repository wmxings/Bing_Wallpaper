This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us'. It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies.",

In the 14th century, Maharawal Gadsi Singh rebuilt the lake, and it was renamed in his honour—marking a new chapter in its enduring legacy.",

On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself.",

    "desc": "For decades, voices across Telangana echoed with the hope of identity and self-governance. Once part of the Telugu-speaking Hyderabad princely state, the region was merged with Andhra Pradesh in 1956. What followed was one of South India's longest statehood movements. After years of protests and political pushback, the dream became a reality on 2 June 2014. Telangana Day now honours that hard-won journey—a story of resilience, separation and a future reclaimed.",

On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world.",
