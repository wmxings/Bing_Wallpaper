    "desc": "For decades, voices across Telangana echoed with the hope of identity and self-governance. Once part of the Telugu-speaking Hyderabad princely state, the region was merged with Andhra Pradesh in 1956. What followed was one of South India's longest statehood movements. After years of protests and political pushback, the dream became a reality on 2 June 2014. Telangana Day now honours that hard-won journey—a story of resilience, separation and a future reclaimed.",

On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world.",
