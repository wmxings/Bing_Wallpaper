    "desc": "Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 1,200 square kilometres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,500 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys. Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of over 2,000 metres, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol.",

Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities. Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 12,000 square kilometres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States.",

This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 kilometres, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights. Every May, the town celebrates the festivals of Sant'Isidoro and Santa Maria 'e Mare with traditional processions. During the festivities, the local flavours shine—especially in seadas, a special dessert sprinkled with golden strawberry-tree honey.",

    "desc": "That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection.",

This green tradition was started in July 1947 by an Indian historian and botanist, Mohinder Singh Randhawa. In 1950, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, then Minister of Food and Agriculture, made it an annual event in the first week of July, officially naming it Van Mahotsav.",
