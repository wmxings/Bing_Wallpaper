Nestled in the Atlantic Ocean, just southeast of Florida and northeast of Cuba, the Bahamas is famous for its beautiful waters, white sandy beaches and vibrant coral reefs. Every corner of the Bahamas is a shade card of blue, but the most captivating of all are the turquoise waters that surround the islands. The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkelling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, the sea glows with a brilliance that feels almost magical.",

    "desc": "If you're looking for a scent-sational summer trip, follow your nose to the Plateau de Valensole in Provence, France. From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 500 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 800 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation. Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail, and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.",

Take the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions.",

Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs.

Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.",

First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.",

This beach is known for its limestone cliffs, where nature has carved out caves that open directly onto the sea. Orosei, a town of about 7,000 residents in the Baronie region, is nestled in the Cedrino Valley just 2.5 kilometres from the sea. Its economy thrives on agriculture, marble quarrying and tourism. This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 kilometres, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights. Every May, the town celebrates the festivals of Sant'Isidoro and Santa Maria 'e Mare with traditional processions. During the festivities, the local flavours shine—especially in seadas, a special dessert sprinkled with golden strawberry-tree honey.",

Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection.",
