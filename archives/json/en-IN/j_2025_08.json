Rooted in deep cultural and religious significance, the celebration honours the beloved elephant-headed deity, a symbol of wisdom and prosperity. Festivities begin with the installation of intricately crafted idols, or murtis, placed in homes and on grand public pandals (temporary stages). Over the next ten days, communities come alive with prayer, music and cultural performances. The festival culminates in a vibrant procession on Ananta Chaturdashi, as the murtis are immersed in rivers or seas in a ritual known as visarjana, symbolising a respectful farewell.",

This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.",

The miners themselves played a key role in building the cathedral that still bears her name. Originally envisioned on a much grander scale—twice its current size—the cathedral's fate was tied to the fortunes of the silver mines. In the years that followed, the Jesuits took over, gradually introducing Baroque elements into the original Gothic design.",

These ground-dwelling songbirds belong to the Oenanthe genus and are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,' pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species. Globally, there are around 20 species of wheatears, but in North America, the northern wheatear is the one you're most likely to encounter.",

The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span over 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either.",

Tucked away in the Adirondack High Peaks in New York, United States, this less-than-a-square-kilometres alpine lake sits at over 800 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—an over 300-metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name.",

Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls, and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.",

At over 3,000 metres, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St. Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. This alpine peak hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics and still boasts some of the most famous ski runs in the country. The 'Piz Nair Wall' is known for its challenging downhill skiing and events like the 2003 World Championship downhill race. Come summer, the snow clears but the trails stay hot.",

    "desc": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama. Ring-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets and rocky outcrops.",

The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.",

    "desc": "There's something timeless about Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, United States—a place where red rock cliffs, winding canyons and ancient stories come together under the desert sky. Long before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations and celestial events.",

From pub basements to park benches, stages appear in the strangest places and shows pop up on quiet streets. Welcome to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, or the Fringe. The story began in 1947, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.",
