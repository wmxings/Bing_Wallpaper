    "desc": "Silent hunters of the night sky, owls are among the most intriguing creatures in the animal kingdom. Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honours their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face.",

These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centres that are the most common. Beyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil or offered as a treat for birds.",

    "desc": "There's something timeless about Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, United States—a place where red rock cliffs, winding canyons and ancient stories come together under the desert sky. Long before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations and celestial events.",
