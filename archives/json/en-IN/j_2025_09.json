While many flock to Amsterdam's canals or Rotterdam's cube houses, this quiet commuter town offers its own architectural twist. Lined up like a mirage, the Rainbow Houses shimmer in bold, painterly hues—a residential block turned an understated cultural landmark.",

The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. Though themes overlap, each community preserves its own unique version.",

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 17–20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.",

It marks the beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change. Sites like Chichén Itzá in Mexico and England's Stonehenge were designed to align with the rising or setting sun during equinox days.",

Less obvious is how their taste for sea urchins helps protect kelp forests. Otters also depend on clean, cold water—their fur traps air for warmth rather than repelling water, making them highly vulnerable to oil spills.",

The scale is staggering: the festival grounds span around 4,20,000 square metres and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around seven million litres of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.",

Seen from over 350 kilometres above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.",

Every movement reflects a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.",

Alpine ridges, quiet forests and one of the longest stretches of undeveloped coastline in the lower 48 of the United States all meet here. Spanning more than 3,500 square kilometres in Washington State, this UNESCO World Heritage Site drew over 3.7 million visitors in 2024. On the western edge of the park, the Hoh Rainforest receives over 3,500 centimetres of rain a year—over 3 metres—and it wears every drop proudly. The Hoh is one of the best-preserved temperate rainforests in the world. And if you're chasing waterfalls, Sol Duc Falls delivers—three streams plunging into a narrow, mossy gorge. Olympic is a solid reminder that the best hikes don't always come with clear skies.",

What truly sets this beach apart is its unique butterfly shape. While this distinctive form draws many curious tourists, it is the tranquil, uncrowded shoreline that has quietly made it one of South Goa's most cherished destinations. It is also said that, now and then, butterflies can be spotted fluttering among the surrounding plants and trees. Dolphins are also known to make playful appearances just off the shore. Unlike busier beaches like Anjuna and Calangute, this peaceful cove offers a more intimate encounter. The beach is also renowned for its vibrant marine life; at low tide, colourful crabs and starfish appear along the shore. Adding to its charm, the lush green forests that embrace the cove create a stunning natural backdrop, making every visit a picture-perfect experience.",

It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.",

While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.",

India's National Literacy Mission sees literacy as more than just knowing how to read, write and do basic arithmetic—it's about putting those skills to work in everyday life. Functional literacy means understanding the causes of deprivation and working to change them. It involves gaining skills to improve one's economic status and overall well-being. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society.",

Wide, clean and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. Then there's the Santa Monica Pier. Built in 1909 and still standing tall on wooden legs, it's got an amusement park called Pacific Park, arcade, restaurants and that famous solar-powered Ferris wheel.",

Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies.",

    "desc": "If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy. But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Alberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style.",

    "desc": "Featured in today's image is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze with shooting stars. These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.",
