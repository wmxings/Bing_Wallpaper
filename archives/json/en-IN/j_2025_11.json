    "desc": "What would you wish for if a single lantern could carry it skyward? Tonight, in northern Thailand, the Yi Peng festival offers that chance. This centuries-old Lanna tradition celebrates the twelfth lunar month with glowing paper lanterns—khom loi—that are released to honour the Buddha. Each lantern is believed to carry away misfortune and light the way toward a brighter future. Children steady the lantern frames, elders whisper blessings and the crowd pauses as hundreds of lights drift higher than the trees. Farther south, the same full moon watches over Loy Krathong, a sister festival, where candlelit rafts glide across the water.",

The featured image shows the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where festivities unfold with splendour. As dawn settles over the marble walkways, pilgrims gather in reverent silence, their hymns rising through the cool November air. The temple's reflection shimmers across the 'sarovar,' the sacred pool that surrounds it; by night it glows against the dark sky as celebrations reach their peak. Rooted in 15th-century Punjab, this festival embodies Guru Nanak's enduring message of unity and compassion. Observed on Kartik Purnima, the full moon day of Kartik in the Nanakshahi calendar, the date shifts each year in the Gregorian calendar, usually falling in November.",

Standing next to the Tower of London and rising over the River Thames since 1894, this London icon knows how to lift spirits—and traffic. With its twin towers, blue-and-white paintwork and bascules that open like a giant's drawbridge, Tower Bridge is less a traffic solution and more a stage performer. For many Indians, Tower Bridge isn't just a London landmark—it's a Bollywood favourite. Scenes from 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and 'Namastey London' have used the bridge as a backdrop for romance and departure, making it instantly recognisable even to those who've never visited England.",
