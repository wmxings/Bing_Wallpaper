    "desc": "On Florida's southern tip lies one of the United States' most unusual landscapes. The Everglades is not a typical swamp or river. It is a slow, shallow sheet of water that drifts south across flat grasslands toward Florida Bay, linking forests, marshes, mangroves and coastal prairies. This subtropical wilderness supports hundreds of species, including alligators, manatees and the endangered Florida panther. Spanning over 6000 square kilometres, it is one of the largest wetland ecosystems in North America—a place where land, sky and water meet in constant motion.",
