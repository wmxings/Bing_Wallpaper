    "desc": "On 2 December 1980, the United States passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), a landmark law that reshaped America's conservation history. With one sweeping law, more than 40 million hectares of Alaska's wild lands gained lasting protection, like the Wrangell–St Elias National Park and Preserve, seen here, now the largest national park in the country. ANILCA balanced preservation with tradition, safeguarding ecosystems while honouring rural subsistence rights.",
