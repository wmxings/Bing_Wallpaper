This small fishing village of about 300 residents is known for its steep mountains, calm fjords and bright red rorbuer—traditional fishermen's cabins—that dot the shoreline. Despite its size, Reine draws thousands of visitors each year.",

It was designed to slow movement, expose approach and reinforce control long before an enemy reached the gates.",

Though repression followed, the movement endured and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.",

    "desc": "Seeing Venice from above is mesmerising, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.",
