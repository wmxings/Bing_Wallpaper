Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighbourhood as well.",

Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.",

This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.",

These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 80 metres, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.",
