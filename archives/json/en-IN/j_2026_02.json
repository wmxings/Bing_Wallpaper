    "desc": "The story of Neuschwanstein Castle begins with the dreams of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who imagined a retreat inspired by medieval legends and grand operas. Set among mountains and forests in Germany, the castle rises with delicate towers and intricate stonework that seem to float above the valley. Although construction started in the nineteenth century, the palace was never fully completed, which adds to its aura of mystery.",

    "desc": "Colour feels at home in Olinda. The house seen in today's image, painted in bold, joyful tones, reflects a city where history and creativity live side by side. Founded in the 16th century in Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, Olinda grew from a colonial stronghold into a cultural landmark shaped by Portuguese architecture, Afro-Brazilian traditions and centuries of artistic expression. Its hills are lined with pastel facades, baroque churches and narrow cobblestone streets that seem designed for wandering rather than rushing.",
