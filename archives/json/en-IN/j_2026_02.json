    "desc": "Red kites are striking birds of prey known for their reddish‑brown bodies, pale heads and long, forked tails that help them steer with impressive precision. Mostly found in Europe, they thrive in countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany. The Chiltern Hills in England are one of the biggest conservation success stories: once nearly wiped out there, the birds rebounded after chicks from Spain were released in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",

    "desc": "You know a place holds stories when geologists, filmmakers and local folklore all claim it for different reasons. Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, United States, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.",

Set among mountains and forests in Germany, the castle rises with delicate towers and intricate stonework that seem to float above the valley. Although construction started in the nineteenth century, the palace was never fully completed, which adds to its aura of mystery.",

Its hills are lined with pastel facades, baroque churches and narrow cobblestone streets that seem designed for wandering rather than rushing.",
