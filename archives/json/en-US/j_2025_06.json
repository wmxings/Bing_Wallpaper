It was only when Congress passed the Flag Resolution on June 14, 1777, that the Stars and Stripes design was adopted as the official flag of the United States. To commemorate this historic milestone, then-president Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 as Flag Day in 1916—a tribute to the banner that came to represent America's identity, values, and unity.",

It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site, and even a lookout for whale-watching.",

Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds.

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts, and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains, and economies.",

Winding over about 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hiking dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests, and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West. But you don't need to go the distance to enjoy its magic. In Southern California, portions of the trail through the San Gabriel Mountains offer great views and rewarding day hikes.",

For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.",

    "desc": "'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales.",
