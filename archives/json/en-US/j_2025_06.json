Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.",

It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 950 feet into the sky—perfect for rock climbing.",

For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.",
