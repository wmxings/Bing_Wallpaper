    "desc": "Today, Canada turns another year older. Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day,' it's the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country's capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill.",
