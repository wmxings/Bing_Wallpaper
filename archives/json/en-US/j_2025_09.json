At this stage, his antlers are more crown than weapon—still covered in velvet. But even now, they hint at a life shaped by instinct, sparring, and the quiet pull of dominance.",

Seen from 225 miles above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.",

Today, on Patriot Day, we honor the fallen and the countless acts of courage that emerged in the face of tragedy, from firefighters and first responders to ordinary citizens who became heroes. At 8:46 AM Eastern Time—the moment the first plane struck the North Tower—Americans observe a moment of silence. Permanent memorials now stand at each of the three sites. Visiting one or volunteering in your community is a meaningful way to participate in the National Day of Service and honor those who continue to serve.",

It involves cutting, drying, and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks molding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.",

While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 10 to 12 inches wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves, and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.",
