    "desc": "Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories. They are nature's ever-moving contribution to our landscapes, flowing through lands and across time. One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed on this day in 1968.",

    "desc": "This year marks another milestone in the legacy of Yosemite National Park, a sanctuary protected since 1864 and celebrated for its awe-inspiring grandeur and ecological significance. Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 1,200 square miles cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.",
