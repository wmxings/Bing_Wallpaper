    "desc": "There are big statues—and then there's the Leshan Giant Buddha. Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi, and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 233 feet tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 92 feet wide, its ears measure nearly 23 feet long, and each foot extends over 28 feet. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries.",

That's exactly the spirit of World Hello Day, celebrated every November 21. This cheerful observance began in 1973 when two American brothers, Brian and Michael McCormack, launched it as a peaceful response to global tensions. They mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to world leaders, inviting them to join the first celebration. Their message was simple yet powerful: personal communication can help preserve peace. Today, people in more than 180 countries participate.",

Conceived in the late 19th century, the Hungarian Parliament Building was designed to reflect a nation's ambition, blending Gothic Revival elegance with distinctly Hungarian motifs. Architect Imre Steindl's vision took shape over two decades through the work of more than 1,000 craftsmen. Even the central dome, rising 315 feet (96 meters) high, carries meaning: the height honors the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol.",

Created by the American Hiking Society, this day celebrates the simple act of walking under open skies and reminds us that health and happiness often begin with a single stride. Across 60,000 miles of US trails, hikers rediscover the quiet magic of forests, the strength in their own breath, and the promise of unspoiled landscapes.",

The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods, or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.",

Reaching up to 23 feet in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem.

Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators. Gladiators, exotic animals, and even staged sea battles thrilled the crowds, while hidden elevators and trapdoors created sudden, dramatic appearances.",

Badlands National Park, carved by wind and water, was redesignated from national monument to national park status in 1978, securing stronger protection within the National Park System. Its cliffs and spires rise above fossil beds that reveal ancient rhinoceroses, camels, and subtropical seas. Yet the park is not only a window into the past; it also safeguards one of the largest remaining tracts of mixed-grass prairie in the US.",
