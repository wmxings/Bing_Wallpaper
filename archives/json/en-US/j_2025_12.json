    "desc": "Have you ever wondered how canals changed the way cities developed? For thousands of years, people have built canals to transport goods, control water flow, and connect places. From ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to medieval Europe, they transformed cities like Venice and Bruges into trade hubs. The Netherlands took this even further—by the 17th century, they were designing waterways that shaped cities such as Amsterdam.",

Instead of hunting for bargains, they hunt for birds—with pencils, rather than pellets. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: count them instead. Over a century later, that simple shift has grown into the world's longest-running citizen-science project.",

Then, in the 1820s, US diplomat Joel Roberts Poinsett spotted the plant, fell for its charm, and sent it home. The rest, as they say, is history—and botany.",

Guanacos are part of the same camelid family as llamas, alpacas, and vicuñas. But unlike their domesticated relatives, they keep things wild. Found mainly in Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, they're built for life at high altitude. Their thick coats help them handle chilly winds, while their padded feet give them the grip to trek across rocky terrain that would make even mountain goats nervous.",

In less than two hours, 19 ships were sunk or damaged, nearly 200 aircraft destroyed, and 2,403 Americans lost their lives. The battleship USS Arizona suffered the most devastating hit: a bomb struck its forward deck, igniting ammunition below and sending the ship to the harbor floor. The surprise assault crippled the US Pacific Fleet and ended America's neutrality in World War II. The next day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt told Congress it was 'a date which will live in infamy,' and the US entered the war.",

On December 6, 1947, the United States established the Everglades National Park, protecting over 1.5 million acres and shifting conservation toward preserving entire ecosystems rather than isolated landmarks.",

With one sweeping law, more than 104 million acres of Alaska's wild lands gained lasting protection, like the Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve, seen here, now the largest national park in the United States. ANILCA balanced preservation with tradition, safeguarding ecosystems while honoring rural subsistence rights.",
