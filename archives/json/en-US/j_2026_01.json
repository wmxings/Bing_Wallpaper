Their large silhouettes move in tight, steady groups across the still water, making their scale hard to miss. With wingspans stretching over 10 feet, they rank among the world's largest flying birds. Lake Kerkini's predictable winter conditions offer reliable, close-range views of their size, grace, and coordinated movement.",

A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centerpiece is haggis, a savory pudding made from minced meat, oats, and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse, and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry, and let the toasts flow.",

Segregation still dictated where people could live, learn, vote, and work; the nation simmered with tension—and the world was watching. At that moment, Martin Luther King, Jr. stepped forward, a Baptist minister and the strategic heart of the civil rights movement. He fought injustice with discipline, clarity, and nonviolent resolve, delivering a vision that reshaped the nation's imagination: a future where freedom was real, dignity was universal, and justice extended to all.",

Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.",

From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.",

In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.",

    "desc": "Seeing Venice from above is mesmerizing, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fueling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art, and landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, and the Rialto Bridge.",
