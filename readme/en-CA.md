If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at over CAD 400 billion. Canada is home to over 800 native bee species, with honey bees playing a major role in pollinating crops like blueberries, apples and canola. Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan lead in honey production. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.
