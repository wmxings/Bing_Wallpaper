Today, we celebrate the paths that connect us with nature and adventure. International Trails Day is typically observed on the first Saturday in June. The Trans Canada Trail hosts events across the country to mark the occasion and celebrate the many volunteers who contribute to the trail system. Pictured here is the Angeles National Forest in California, United States. Home to towering pines and rugged ridgelines, this forest also hosts a stretch of the legendary Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Winding 4,265 kilometres from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hike dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West. But you don't need to go the distance to enjoy its magic.
