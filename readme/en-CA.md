Toronto's summer ritual rolls in today—big wheels turning, bands tuning up and crowds filing through the gates. The Canadian National Exhibition is back, and it's bringing the full line-up with it. From the gravity-defying Orbitor ride, seen in today's image, to deep-fried everything, The Ex blends nostalgia with new thrills each year. First held in 1879, it started as a showcase of agriculture and technology. While these themes still feature in areas like the Farm Pavilion and Innovation Garage, the exhibition now also includes large-scale entertainment and sports programming.
