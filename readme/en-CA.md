[2025-04-23 Much ado about Shakespeare Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London, England(© Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlobeTheatre_EN-CA7568109228_UHD.jpg)
'All the world's a stage ...' and only a few have shaped that stage like William Shakespeare. Every April 23, we celebrate Shakespeare Day, honouring one of England's greatest playwrights and poets. This date is special as it marks both his birth and death. Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionised English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Even four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge and inspire.
