Every May, Canadians roll out the red carpet and prep the fireworks for a queen who never set foot here. Victoria Day marks Queen Victoria's birthday—24 May—and has been observed since 1845, celebrated on the Monday preceding that date. Officially recognised as a holiday in the mid-19th century, it's a nod to the country's colonial roots and a reminder of the queen's lasting influence. It's more than just a long weekend; for many, it marks the unofficial start of summer, with parades, picnics and festivities across the country, particularly in British Columbia.
