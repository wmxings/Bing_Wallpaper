Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, or the Tiger's Nest—a Buddhist monastery perched 3,000 metres above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava—the figure who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan—meditated and taught his students. Legend has it that an emperor's former wife transformed into a tigress out of devotion and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and is believed to have emerged in eight incarnations, giving the monastery its name—the 'Tiger's Nest.'
