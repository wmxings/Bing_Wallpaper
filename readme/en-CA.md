[2025-07-24 Birds of a feather stick together Family of ashy woodswallows perched on a branch(© Captain Skyhigh/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AshyWoodswallow_EN-CA5890367905_UHD.jpg)
Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion? Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes and showing up at every family gathering. The bond may stretch over time and distance, but it seldom fades. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair.
