[2026-01-29 A tall story of Milwaukee The eight-story open atrium of Milwaukee City Hall, Wisconsin, United States(© lavin photography/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MilwaukeeHall_EN-CA4166565215_UHD.jpg)
Milwaukee City Hall, in the state of Wisconsin, is one of the city's most recognisable landmarks. Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighbourhood as well.
