What's your winter personality: cosy wanderer or slope-chaser? Whistler, in British Columbia, lets you try both in the same day. This resort municipality sits about 125 kilometres north of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains, with two main ski peaks: Whistler and Blackcomb. These are linked by the PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola, famous for giving a suspended, panoramic valley view in just a few minutes of travel. The area gained fame when it co-hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, and some of those venues are still open to the public today. The name 'Whistler' comes from the high-pitched call of the local hoary marmots that were once common around the slopes.
