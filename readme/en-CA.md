Yoho sounds like something you'd shout from a mountaintop—and honestly, you might find yourself doing just that. Established in 1886, Yoho National Park in British Columbia is known for its towering cliffs, glacial lakes and thunderous waterfalls. It's the second oldest national park in Canada and part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. Covering 1,313 square kilometres, the park is home to the Burgess Shale, a globally recognised fossil site. It consists of well-preserved marine life dating back over 500 million years—vital to understanding early evolution.
