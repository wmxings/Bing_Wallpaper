Silent hunters of the night sky, owls are among the most intriguing creatures in the animal kingdom. Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honours their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face.
