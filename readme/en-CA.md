In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy.
