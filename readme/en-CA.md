Standing in Zion National Park in Utah, United States, it is impossible not to feel small. Massive sandstone cliffs, sculpted over millions of years, rise towards the sky. It became a national park in 1919, but its history stretches much further back. The Ancestral Puebloans and later the Southern Paiute people lived here, relying on the Virgin River. Evidence of their presence remains in petroglyphs and archaeological sites. Today, the river continues to carve through the landscape, creating canyons that attract hikers and climbers.
