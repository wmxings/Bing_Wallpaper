[2025-12-22 From Hoffmann's pages to global stages 'The Nutcracker' performed by the Turkish State Opera and Ballet in Ankara, Türkiye(© Anadolu/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerAnkara_EN-CA0772457204_UHD.jpg)
As Christmas approaches across Canada, each sunset gives way to a soft glow of festive lights—from window candles in Toronto homes to snowy displays in prairie towns—bringing a touch of wonder and preparing us for the holiday season. One of the world's most beloved stage works, 'The Nutcracker,' is rooted in this very sense of magic. The story unfolds on Christmas Eve, when Clara receives a nutcracker as a gift. As night falls and the household drifts into sleep, the girl and her nutcracker embark on a fantastical journey—battling the Mouse King and wandering through the Land of Sweets. Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, accompanied by music that has become iconic.
