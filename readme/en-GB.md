For one Sunday in March, the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries take a break from the usual hustle to honour mums with flowers, cards and the occasional burnt toast in bed. Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration.
