Lights on, curtains rise—it's World Theatre Day. Since 1961, this annual event by the International Theatre Institute (ITI) has united audiences and artists in a shared appreciation of storytelling, creativity and culture. Every year, a renowned theatre figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. These messages highlight theatre's role in society—be it as a mirror to reality, an agent of change, or a refuge for the imagination. From Shakespeare's soliloquies to experimental avant-garde productions, theatre has continuously evolved while holding onto its core: human connection.
