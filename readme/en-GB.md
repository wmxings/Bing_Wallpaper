Today is Tolkien Reading Day. A time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves and one particularly famous ring. But why this date? March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. This day was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore JRR Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favourite moments and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?
