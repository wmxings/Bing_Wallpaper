Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything. As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society. As a result, digital engagement has become both a challenge and an opportunity.
