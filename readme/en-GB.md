Welcome to Saguaro National Park in Arizona, United States. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak, which is the tallest point in the Tucson Mountains at more than 1,400 metres. Hikers can reach the summit via trails like King Canyon, Hugh Norris or Sweetwater, all winding through towering saguaros, prickly pear cacti and desert wildflowers. At the top of the park, the Tucson Basin, Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains stretch into the horizon, making the climb worth every step. Named after John Wasson, a 19th-century American journalist, the peak also holds traces of the Hohokam people and Arizona's mining past, including the Gould Mine. Whether you're here for the views, history, or challenge, Wasson Peak is a true desert adventure—just don't underestimate the Arizona sun!
