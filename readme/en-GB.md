Every August, the Isle of Wight breathes garlic. Not metaphorically—literally. The island's air fills with the unmistakable aroma of this plant species as thousands of visitors gather for a festival that's anything but bland. Welcome to The Isle of Wight Garlic Festival, where this humble bulb receives star treatment. What began in the 1980s as a fundraising event has grown into a two-day garlic gala celebrating local produce, food innovation and community spirit. At the heart of it all is the Isle of Wight Garlic Farm, famous for its black garlic, elephant garlic and just about every variety in between. Their garlic is so good, it doesn't just ward off vampires—it attracts fans from across the globe.
