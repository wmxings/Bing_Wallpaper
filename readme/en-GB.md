If you've ever looked at a tree and thought, 'That doesn't look like anything I've seen before,' you might have stumbled upon a baobab. These majestic giants are often referred to as the 'upside-down trees' because of their unusual appearance, with their wide, thick trunks resembling roots reaching for the sky. Native to Africa, Madagascar and parts of Australia, baobabs have earned their nickname due to their quirky silhouette, but there's much more to them than meets the eye.
