Spanning over four miles with 30 formidable fences, including the notorious Becher's Brook and The Chair, it's a challenge where anything can happen. Since its first run in 1839, the Grand National has produced unforgettable moments, from steeplechaser Red Rum's three historic wins to shock victories like steeplechaser Mon Mome's 100/1 triumph in 2009. Millions watch, and cheer, making it a national tradition. With every race comes the chance for a new underdog story or a champion's rise. So, who will clear the final fence first this year? Here, surprises are always part of the course.
