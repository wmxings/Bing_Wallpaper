Sharks have been around for over 400 million years—outlasting dinosaurs, surviving ice ages and weathering mass extinctions. They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list.
