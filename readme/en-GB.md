Every year, London swaps its signature grey for every shade of the rainbow, as Pride in London steps off with colour, music and a message. But this isn't just a glitter parade—it's part protest, part celebration and all heart. The event has its roots in 1972, just three years after the Stonewall Uprising in New York City, United States. Inspired by that act of resistance, about 2,000 people gathered in London for its first Pride march, walking from Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park. That small march grew into one of the United Kingdom's largest annual events. Today, hundreds of thousands fill the streets, from drag queens and dykes on bikes to queer teens and allies with banners.
