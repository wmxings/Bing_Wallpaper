The London Marathon isn't just a race—it is a celebration of endurance, charity and the city itself. Today, over 56,000 runners take on the challenge, making 2025 the biggest edition yet. Since its debut in 1981, the event has been drawing elite athletes, charity fundraisers and first-time runners alike. The London Marathon is one of the world's seven major marathons, known for its fast course and huge crowds. British distance legend Paula Radcliffe set the women's world record here in 2003, clocking 2:15:25—a time that remained unbeaten for 16 years. This year, the demand is unreal—840,000+ hopefuls entered the ballot. That's a record-smashing number, with 49% of UK applicants being women and a significant rise in young runners.
