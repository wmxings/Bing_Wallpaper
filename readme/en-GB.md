[2025-05-10 Gilded glory Minnesota State Capitol, St Paul, Minnesota, United States(© lavin photography/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MinnesotaRotunda_EN-GB8105337991_UHD.jpg)
A grand and gilded sight—the heart of the Minnesota State Capitol in the United States is waiting to be explored. Home to the Minnesota Senate, the House of Representatives, the governor's office and the attorney general's office, this building also houses a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court. Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world.
