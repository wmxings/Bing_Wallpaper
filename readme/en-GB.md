If you've ever wandered through downtown Milwaukee in the United States and looked up in awe, chances are you were staring at the iconic Milwaukee City Hall. Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighbourhood as well.
