[2025-03-28 A cosy cradle Female black-naped monarch nesting(© komkrit tonusin/Alamy)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NestingMonarch_EN-GB8009331215_UHD.jpg)
Watch closely; you might catch a glimpse of the black-naped monarch. This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy.
