[2025-12-18 The temple that stands up to stone Granite rocks and gopuram of the Virupaksha Temple, Hampi, Karnataka(© Skouatroulio/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GopuramVirupaksha_EN-IN6686101876_UHD.jpg)
Hampi has a way of telling its story without saying much. The valley is filled with massive granite boulders that look untouched by time, and between them rises the gopuram of the Virupaksha Temple, the tall gateway tower that defines its skyline. The rocks are far older than the empire that once ruled here, shaped by natural forces long before a city ever existed. The gopuram, pale and geometric against the rugged terrain, gives the landscape a clear point of focus. Together they form a view that is both stark and striking, the kind that stays with you even after a quick glance.
