[2025-06-11 A tidal ballet Greater flamingos, Lüderitz, Namibia(© Karine Aigner/TANDEM Stills + Motion)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlamingosNamibia_EN-IN8571629692_UHD.jpg)
In Lüderitz, Namibia, these birds aren't just passing through—they're standing their ground. Literally. On one leg. These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering over 120 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot. That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones.
