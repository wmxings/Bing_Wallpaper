[2025-09-14 Moss and mist A waterfall in Olympic National Park, Washington, United States(© Chris Moore/TANDEM Stills + Motion)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HohWaterfall_EN-IN1403285660_UHD.jpg)
Olympic National Park covers a rare mix of terrain—and that's part of its unique appeal. Alpine ridges, quiet forests and one of the longest stretches of undeveloped coastline in the lower 48 of the United States all meet here. Spanning more than 3,500 square kilometres in Washington State, this UNESCO World Heritage Site drew over 3.7 million visitors in 2024. On the western edge of the park, the Hoh Rainforest receives over 3,500 centimetres of rain a year—over 3 metres—and it wears every drop proudly. The Hoh is one of the best-preserved temperate rainforests in the world. And if you're chasing waterfalls, Sol Duc Falls delivers—three streams plunging into a narrow, mossy gorge. Olympic is a solid reminder that the best hikes don't always come with clear skies.
