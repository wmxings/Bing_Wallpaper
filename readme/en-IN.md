Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes. With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. Santa Maddalena is small, quiet and deeply rooted in local Ladin and Tyrolean traditions. Wooden chalets dot the green hills, and cows graze in meadows that seem painted into place. Although it feels remote, the village is a gateway to some of the Dolomites' best hiking, including trails through Puez-Odle Nature Park.
