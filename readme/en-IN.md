Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow not more than 1 metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. So, take a moment to appreciate these incredible ecosystem engineers and their hardworking, tree-chomping ways. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?
