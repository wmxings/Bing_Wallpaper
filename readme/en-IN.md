April 10 rolls around, and suddenly, childhood rivalries, inside jokes and borrowed clothes come flooding back. Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Siblings Day has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. In India, the bond between siblings is celebrated each year through Raksha Bandhan, a tradition where sisters tie a rakhi—a sacred thread—around their brother's wrist. This heartfelt gesture symbolises love, protection and the deep connection shared between siblings.
