In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is over 40 centimetres tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands. The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves more than 3 metres in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world.
