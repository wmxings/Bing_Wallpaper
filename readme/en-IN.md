Masai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa. Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. The Masai giraffe is easily recognised by its jagged, irregular spots and inhabits various regions across eastern Africa. It is the largest giraffe species and the tallest land animal on Earth. Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is its long neck, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of its total height.
