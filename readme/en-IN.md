Today, we are in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States. This spot, known as Calcite Springs Overlook, is where nature puts on a spectacular show—steaming vents, rugged cliffs and the ribbon of the river carving through the canyon tell stories millions of years in the making. This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.
