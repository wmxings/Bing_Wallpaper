[2025-09-24 The lonely giant Devils Tower National Monument, Wyoming, United States(© Laura Hedien/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BearLodge_EN-IN2528556725_UHD.jpg)
Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming in the United States, stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains. As you approach Devils Tower, every curve in the road unveils a new view—whether you're arriving from the highway, winding toward the visitor centre or following the Tower Trail on foot. The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. Though themes overlap, each community preserves its own unique version.
