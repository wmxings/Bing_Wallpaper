Long ago, in the heart of the desert, King Rawal Jaisal, the founder of Jaisalmer, envisioned a lifeline for his city. In 1156 CE, he built an artificial lake to meet the water needs of the city's inhabitants. Thus, came into being the Gadsisar Rainwater Lake, originally named Jaisalasar Lake after its creator, Rawal Jaisal. In the 14th century, Maharawal Gadsi Singh rebuilt the lake, and it was renamed in his honour—marking a new chapter in its enduring legacy.
