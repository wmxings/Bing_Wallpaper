Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet. Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for.
