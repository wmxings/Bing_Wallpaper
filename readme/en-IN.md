[2025-12-12 The plant that paints the holidays red Spotted poinsettia(© DigiPub/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpeckledPoinsettia_EN-IN7588134069_UHD.jpg)
Some plants simply sit quietly on windowsills. The poinsettia? It demands the spotlight — bright, bold and as red as Rudolph's nose. Long before it became a popular Christmas decoration, it grew wild in Mexico, where the Aztecs used its leaves for dyes and its sap for traditional remedies. In the 19th century, it travelled across continents as people admired its vivid colour during colder months, eventually finding its place in winter celebrations around the world.
