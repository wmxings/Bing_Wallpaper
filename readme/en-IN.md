Imagine a world without colour, music or design—how dull would life be? Every April 15, World Art Day reminds us of the beauty, inspiration and culture that art brings into our lives. Established by the International Association of Art in honour of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this global celebration promotes creativity in all its forms. Art has been a cornerstone of human civilisation for thousands of years, from prehistoric cave paintings to digital masterpieces. Beyond the sculptures and paintings found in galleries and museums, art also lives in street murals, sand sculptures and even beach art, as seen here, proving that creativity knows no bounds. World Art Day, officially observed in 21 countries, is a celebration for everyone, whether you're a collector, a creator or simply someone who finds joy in the colors and textures of everyday life.
