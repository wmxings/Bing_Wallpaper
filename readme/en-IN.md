[2025-08-08 All for falls and falls for all The Three Musketeers Falls at Iguazú Falls, Argentina(© Mark Meredith/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IguazuArgentina_EN-IN3106576952_UHD.jpg)
No voice is loud enough to drown out the roar of Iguazú Falls. The sheer presence of this natural wonder is overwhelming as it straddles the border between Argentina and Brazil. This vast waterfall system stretches more than 3 kilometres and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist. Today's image captures one of the spectacular sights on the Argentine side—The Three Musketeers Falls, a trio of powerful streams plunging side by side into the Iguazú River below, framed by lush subtropical rainforest. Interestingly, although the falls are located in Argentina, they are only visible and accessible from the Brazilian side.
