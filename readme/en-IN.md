Drive up Mount Hamilton in the Bay Area, California, United States, and immerse yourself in stunning views and rich history. Over 31-kilometre Mount Hamilton Road is part of State Route 130. It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at over 1,200 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day.
