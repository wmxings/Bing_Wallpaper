Sharks have been around for over 400 million years—outlasting dinosaurs, surviving ice ages and weathering mass extinctions. They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. Take the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions.
