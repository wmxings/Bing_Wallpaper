This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 600-square-metre fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications. International Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries.
