[2025-11-14 Sketched into history Artist Saype poses with his land art painting at UN Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland(© Valentin Flauraud/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaypeGeneva_EN-IN7312721048_UHD.jpg)
On the lawns of the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, two children lean over a blank page, sketching the world as they dream it could be. This scene unfolds in 'World in Progress,' a monumental land art painting created by Swiss-French artist Saype in 2020. Made with biodegradable paint, the artwork depicts the vision and innocence at the heart of children's rights—a hope captured in today's featured image. Look closer, and you will spot the artist himself posing with his work.
