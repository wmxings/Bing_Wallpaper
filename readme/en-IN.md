The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, California, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities. Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 12,000 square kilometres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States.
