Long before neckties and greeting cards, Father's Day began with a daughter's quiet act of remembrance and steadfast love. In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane. She sought to pay tribute to her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads.
