Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything. As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship. India's National Literacy Mission sees literacy as more than just knowing how to read, write and do basic arithmetic—it's about putting those skills to work in everyday life. Functional literacy means understanding the causes of deprivation and working to change them. It involves gaining skills to improve one's economic status and overall well-being. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society.
