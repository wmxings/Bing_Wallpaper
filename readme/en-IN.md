Strolling through the streets during Holi is like stepping into a kaleidoscope of colours. People of all ages come together, playing with gulal and drenching each other with water. Among the many traditions associated with this festival, one stands out—Lathmar Holi, or the 'Holi of sticks,' seen in today's image. This unique celebration takes place in the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon in Uttar Pradesh. It is observed the day after Laddu Holi, where women playfully shower men with laddoos. Rooted in the legend of Radha and Krishna, this festival brings an age-old tale to life. As the story goes, Lord Krishna, hailing from Nandgaon and regarded as the son-in-law of Vrishabhanu, wished to drench his beloved Radha and her friends in colours. However, when he and his companions arrived in Barsana, they were met with playful resistance—Radha and her friends chased them away with sticks. This lively tradition continues to this day during Holi.
