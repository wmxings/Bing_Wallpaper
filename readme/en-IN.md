[2025-05-31 An ancient glacial landscape Knuthöjdsmossen nature reserve, Sweden(© Sven Halling/DEEPOL/plainpicture)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwedenReserve_EN-IN3145271969_UHD.jpg)
Discover the enchanting Knuthöjdsmossen nature reserve, which covers a little more than 1 square kilometre near Hällefors city in Sweden. This tranquil haven features a loop on boardwalks that meanders through the bog, showcasing several small lakes, sand dunes, marshes and pines. Parts of the loop are accessible by wheelchair and pram. The landscape is shaped by the last inland ice that melted around 10,000 years ago, leaving behind moraine (accumulation of unconsolidated debris) and glacial river sand. The most common trees in the park are pines, but various shrubs can also be found, such as dwarf birch, crowberry and wild rosemary.
