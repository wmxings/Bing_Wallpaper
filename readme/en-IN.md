Lights on, curtains rise—it's World Theatre Day. Since 1961, this annual event by the International Theatre Institute (ITI) has united audiences and artists in a shared appreciation of storytelling, creativity and culture. Every year, a renowned theatre figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. So, what better place to celebrate today than at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus? Located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, this stone Roman theatre has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia. Built in 161 CE by the wealthy Roman Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, this ancient venue has hosted everything from classical tragedies to modern-day concerts. Despite the passing centuries, its acoustics still strike the right chord.
