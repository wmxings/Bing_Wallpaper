Life on Earth, from tiny bacteria to towering trees, is interconnected. International Day for Biological Diversity is about celebrating this web of life that keeps our planet thriving. Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. India is one of the world's most biodiverse countries, home to nearly 10% of global species. Its ecological wealth is deeply woven into its culture, shaped over thousands of years. But this delicate balance is under threat—from rising populations and climate change to weak enforcement of environmental laws. As species edge toward extinction, it's not just the natural food chain that suffers, but also the livelihoods and traditions of millions who rely on this biodiversity to sustain their way of life.
