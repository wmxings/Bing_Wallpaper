Books out, Rabindra Sangeet on loop and hearts full—because it's Rabindra Jayanti. The day is deeply cherished by Tagore lovers across the globe. Observed annually on the 25th day of Boishakh in the Bengali calendar (usually early May), it commemorates the birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. The celebrations are most vibrant at Santiniketan, particularly at Visva-Bharati University, founded by Tagore. Born in 1861, Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath and was revered as Gurudeb, Kobiguru and Biswokob. He reshaped literature, music and art during the Bengal Renaissance. He also became the first non-European—and the first lyricist—to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his ethereal work 'Gitanjali.'
