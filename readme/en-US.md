It's time to jazz up—literally. From the smoky clubs of New Orleans to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures, and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue, and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood.
