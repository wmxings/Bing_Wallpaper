[2025-05-10 Gilded glory Minnesota State Capitol, St. Paul, Minnesota(© lavin photography/Getty Images)](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MinnesotaRotunda_EN-US6605011856_UHD.jpg)
A grand and gilded sight—the heart of the Minnesota State Capitol is waiting to be explored. Home to the Minnesota Senate, the House of Representatives, the governor's office, and the attorney general's office, this building also houses a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court. Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass, and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world.
