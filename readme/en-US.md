In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village met unexpected resistance. Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. The first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall. Holding signs and chanting for liberation, they demanded visibility, rights, and justice.
