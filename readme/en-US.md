Libraries are magical places. They are home to books full of stories and knowledge, provide easy access to resources that might not be affordable for all, and offer spaces for book clubs, author talks, and other social gatherings. Without a doubt, our society benefits from libraries in several ways. To motivate people to read and take advantage of these institutions, the National Book Committee initiated an event series. The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture. The George Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has earned the prestigious nickname, 'the cathedral of books.' Take today's image as inspiration for the theme of the 2025 National Library Week: 'Drawn to the Library.'
