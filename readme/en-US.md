A global shoutout to the planet we all call home. On World Environment Day, the world hits pause to reflect and act for a greener future. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.
