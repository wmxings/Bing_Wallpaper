It's not polished or curated—and that's exactly the point. Drive just over an hour north of San Francisco, and you'll reach Point Reyes National Seashore—a place where fog drifts slowly, tule elk roam freely, and time seems to pause. Established by Congress on this day in 1962, the park was set aside to protect this piece of coastline for public enjoyment and environmental conservation. It covers over 100 square miles and features an impressive array of landscapes, from coastal prairie and blustery headlands to sandy shores and Douglas fir woodlands.
