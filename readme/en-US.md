Planes, progress, and a whole lot of sky. National Aviation Day gives us a reason to pause and appreciate how aviation has shaped the modern world—and the innovators who dared to dream of flight. The national day was established in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to honor Orville Wright's contributions to aviation. Wright, born on this day in 1871, achieved the first powered, controlled flight in 1903 along with his brother Wilbur. The day is recognized as an opportunity to promote the advancement of aviation through public events and educational activities. Many aviation museums offer free or discounted entry, and airfields often hold open houses to engage the community.
