Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water? Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile, and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognized as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.
