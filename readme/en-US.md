Lights on, curtains rise—it's World Theater Day. Since 1961, this annual event by the International Theater Institute (ITI) has united audiences and artists in a shared appreciation of storytelling, creativity, and culture. Every year, a renowned theater figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. These messages highlight theater's role in society—be it as a mirror to reality, an agent of change, or a refuge for the imagination. From Shakespeare's soliloquies to experimental avant-garde productions, theater has continuously evolved while holding onto its core: human connection.
